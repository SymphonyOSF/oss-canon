The getJsonObject method of builders sets the attribute using getCamelName() which means if the model defines name which don't follow that
patterm the generated JSON is wrong.

Canon2 needs to throw an error for attributes which are defined with non camel case names when converting from canon1 syntax
so that existing schemas can be rewritten so
that they match existing serialized objects.
